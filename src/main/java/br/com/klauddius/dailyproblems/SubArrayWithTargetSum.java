     * Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Amazon:
     * <p>
     * You are given an array of integers, and an integer K. Return the subarray which sums to K. You can assume that a solution will always exist.
     * <p>
     * def find_continuous_k(list, k):
     * # Fill this in.
     * <p>
     * print find_continuous_k([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2], 14)
     * # [2, 5, 7]
     * <p>
     * Can you do this in linear time?

     * @param array containing input data
     * @param k representing the target sum
     * @return subarray with all items which sums to k
